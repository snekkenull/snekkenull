###🦖Experiecne

Hi, Ayo! This is Vila.
I'm an experienced professional with a rich background in operation management in IT and intellectual property field. 
Over the years, I've worn many hats including operating supervisor, brand manager, and business product manager.

My journey has equipped me with a deep understanding of government policies and specific market consultation. 
I stay attuned to social dynamics and have a wealth of entrepreneurial experience in the cultural media sector.

Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, I've remained resilient and committed to my path. 
I have gone through a long way of life, but the coding is not.
It is a challenge and one of my ways to challenge myself. **As curious like a boy, such is life.**
